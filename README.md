# MapUncertaintyPrediction
This repository contains the official implementation of [Producing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16439) published in CVPR 2024. 

The unorganized version is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kLfPWAVKAELBiEPeGwpFdlrMRDdTb3ct/view?usp=sharing). Please follow the rough_instructions.txt to explore the code. I will finish tidying it up after I complete my exams. Thank you for your support!
